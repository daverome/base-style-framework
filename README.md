FTS UI Kit
====================

FTS UI Kit consistently styles markup elements across all browsers, as far back as IE8, by incorporating Normalize.css from the start and adding a light coating of styling and additional pre-sets on top of it.



## Base

We cover all the things!
But to make that a little easier to process, here's a bulleted list of all the things:

* Typographical Elements
  * Headings 1-6
  * Paragraphs
  * Links
  * Lists
  * Quotes
  * Additional inline elements & markup patterns
* Navigation
* Form Elements
  * Groupers
  * Text Inputs
  * Input Buttons & Range
  * Menus (select, datalist)
* Media
  * Images & SVG
  * Audio, Video, Canvas
  * Figure & Figcaption
* Tables
* Progress Bar
* iFrame
* Dialog


## Add-on Components

The point of FTS UI Kit is to provide standard styling even in the instance of an inability to use classes or adhere to special markup patterns. However, there are just some elements that can not be styled properly without some additional love and care.

With that said, FTS UI Kit has an additional library of helper classes and markup patterns (add-ons) that goes beyond what can be done with strictly styling markup alone.

Those add-ons include extended styling for:

* Emphasis Blocks
* Floats
* Form Elements
* Tables
* Width & Basic Fluid Grid



## Demos

To see demos of all the different standard and add-on components in FTS UI Kit, visit the [FTS UI Kit Demo Site](#coming_someday!)



#### Production Ready

Want to just get started with the default FTS UI Kit styling?

Download the [FTS UI Kit Standard CSS](/css/base-styles.css) and include it in your project:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/base-styles.css" />```


Looking to go beyond the standard and utilize all of FTS UI Kit's add-on components as well?

Download the [FTS UI Kit Plus CSS](css/base-styles--plus.css) and include it in your project:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/base-styles--plus.css" />```




#### Tinker Away

If you want to start poking around the source files and customizing your build of FTS UI Kit, you'll need to download or clone the FTS UI Kit repo.

You can then either modify the uncompressed FTS UI Kit CSS files, or if you are comfortable with Sass, you can modify the source files.

If you need to install Sass on your machine, you can read how to do that here: http://sass-lang.com/install

The Sass files are broken up into various partials for organization.

<pre>
sass
|
|__ base
|    contains all files for styling that effects standard HTML markup
|     |
|     |
|     |__ __config
|       files that allow you to change certain styling values via variables,
|       without needing to edit the core sass files.
|
|
|__ addons
|    contains all files for helper classes to expand upon the base styling
|
|__ base-styles.scss
|    imports all base styles into a single base-styles.css file
|
|
|__ base-styles--plus.scss
     imports all base styles & add-ons into a single base-styles--plus.css file
</pre>
